        <h3>What is GameStore?</h3>
        <p>GameStore is an online Games platform that can be used to play games on the browser, share own created games
            to the community to showcase their skill of developing games. The platform consists mainly HTML based games
            capable of running on the browser itself. In the initial version v1 only the games that
            are hosted by the user itself and they can be hosted free of cost anywhere from Github pages, Render,
            Railway or other hosting platforms. The app is in very initial stages and only contains the games developed
            by me as part of javascript learning experience, hopely many games will be added onwards from here.
            Explaining the structure of the website for v1 :
            1. Marketplace : Scroll the Marketplace of many games and save any games from the collection shared within
            the community.
            2. Saved collection : The games saved by you are here, play the games from here by visiting the game link
            using the Play Game button.
            3. Share Game : Share games with the community to showcase the uniqueness of your game, and also to increase
            the amount of games on this platform, thanks.

            Many more games to be added, features to be supported and scaling to be done in the future for this
            platform. </p>
